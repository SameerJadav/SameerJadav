# Hi there, I'm Sameer

I am a 20-year-old JavaScript/TypeScript developer who specializes in building performant, scalable, and accessible applications using Next.js and serverless technologies. I am also exploring Svelte to gain experience with different frameworks. Open-source contributions are a significant part of my work, as I've contributed to several open source projects and all of my projects are open-source. Additionally, I write blogs to share my knowledge, enhance my writing skills and become more articulate.

I'm currently looking for a new role as a developer. Hire me?
