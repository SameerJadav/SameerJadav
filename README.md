# Hi there, I'm Sameer

I'm a self-taught developer living in India. I enjoy all kinds of programming and am currently learning Go, while also working on improving my understanding of core computer science concepts and DSA. I tend to work on projects that solve problems I face or help me learn new things.

I'm currently looking for a new role as a developer. Hire me?
