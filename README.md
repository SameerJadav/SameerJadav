# Hi there, I'm Sameer

I am a 19-year-old JavaScript/TypeScript developer who specializes in building full-stack applications using Next.js and serverless technologies. Currently, I am also exploring Svelte to gain experience with different frameworks. Open-source contributions are a significant part of my work, as all of my projects are open-source. Additionally, I write blogs to enhance my writing skills and become more articulate.
